Project Creation Script
This script automates the creation of a new .NET solution and multiple microservices within that solution. The script prompts the user for the solution name and path to create the solution directory. Then it prompts for the number of microservices to be created within the solution.

For each microservice, the script creates the following directories:

Domain
Application
Infrastructure
Api
Tests

Additionally, the script creates the following projects within each microservice:

Class Library for the Domain layer
Class Library for the Application layer
Class Library for the Infrastructure layer
Web API for the Api layer
XUnit for the Tests layer

Finally, the script adds the created projects to the solution and sets the project references.

Requirements
PowerShell version 5.1 or later
.NET Core SDK version 3.1 or later

Usage
Open PowerShell
Navigate to the directory where you want to create the new .NET solution

Execute the script using the following command:

Copy code
.\Add-Update-microservices.ps1
Follow the prompts to enter the solution name and path, as well as the number of microservices to be created.

Note: This script assumes that you are using the recommended .NET solution and project structure for microservices architecture. If you have a different structure or want to modify the script to fit your needs, you will need to make changes to the script accordingly.
