PowerShell Solution and Microservice Creator
This PowerShell script allows you to create a .NET solution with multiple microservice projects. It ensures that the input for the solution and microservice names follow valid naming conventions. The script creates the necessary directories, projects, and project references, and adds them to the solution. It also handles existing solutions and provides an option to add multiple microservices. Make sure you have the .NET CLI installed. To run the script, copy and paste it into PowerShell, provide the required inputs, and follow the prompts.
